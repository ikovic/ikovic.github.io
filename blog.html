                                    <p>A few days ago I've stumbled across a very interesting article by Demir
                                        Selmanovic published
                                        on
                                        <a href="https://www.toptal.com/javascript/asynchronous-javascript-async-await-tutorial">Toptal
                                            blog</a>. The author goes over a brief history of asynchronous JavaScript,
                                        and compares the three existing approaches: callbacks, promises and
                                        async/await.
                                        That inspired me to think about my experience with async JavaScript because in
                                        my
                                        work I've had my share of all three approaches. Here are a few thoughts of my
                                        own
                                        on the same subject.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4 class="has-text-centered is-4">Generators - the missing link?</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The first thing that came to mind was that the ES6 generators were omitted from
                                        the article. I understand the reasoning -
                                        it seems they never got enough popularity on their own. Based on the various
                                        reactions
                                        on social networks, I'd say that the generators by themselves require a certain
                                        way
                                        of thinking which is probably not natural for a web programmer dealing with
                                        business
                                        applications. Also, they do require some setup to solve the usual async
                                        problems.
                                        I'd still mention them, mainly because of these two reasons:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>async/await is based on
                                                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function#Description">combining
                                                    promises and generators</a>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>generators are an integral part of
                                                <a href="https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga">Redux Saga</a>, a
                                                relevant package in Redux world
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        In my opinion, async/await solves the async problem good enough without any
                                        setup, so I don't see myself using generators
                                        directly if I have async/await available. Maybe they just got available in the
                                        wrong
                                        time - async/await came too fast and solved the same problem in a way that the
                                        majority
                                        of developers preferred.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4 class="has-text-centered is-4">Cancellation as the common pain point</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        There is a problem shared by all three approaches - it is not possible to
                                        cancel an async function once it was called. At
                                        least not in a standard way. How does that hurt us? Let's say you are
                                        implementing
                                        an autocomplete control, and you dispatch multiple requests as the user types
                                        in
                                        new characters. What if the response for the previous request comes after the
                                        response
                                        for the last request? If you did nothing to prevent that, you will end up with
                                        wrong
                                        search results displayed. So how do we fix this? Three approaches come to mind:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                <strong>Use a library</strong>. There isn't a standard solution yet
                                                since there are
                                                trade offs in different ways to solve this problem.
                                                <a href="https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird">Bluebird</a> is a
                                                powerful Promise polyfill which adds a lot of utility functions
                                                to Promise API, while
                                                <a href="https://github.com/getify/CAF">CAF</a> is a simpler solution,
                                                focused only on cancellation of async flows.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <strong>Roll your own solution</strong>. Even popular frameworks like
                                                <a href="https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/708193d2273afc7377df35c61f4eda022b040c05/lib/router/router.js#L298">next.js</a>
                                                handle this problem in their own way.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Take a completely different approach and use
                                                <strong>streams</strong>. Angular uses observables by
                                                <a href="https://angular.io/guide/observables-in-angular">default</a>,
                                                and they offer a built in way to cancel async operations. Just
                                                expect to read a lot and spend some time wrapping your mind around
                                                this.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Some of the presented approaches are just workarounds, so it's up to you to
                                        find an ideal solution for your specific problem.

                                    <p>So many times I want to try out a new idea, some new approach to solving a kind
                                        of problem
                                        I read on some blog. Usually I open the console in browser, but then I have to
                                        deal
                                        with bad autocomplete and uncomfortable editing. Next step is to open my text
                                        editor
                                        and create an empty project. Moment after I'm missing the support of ESLint and
                                        Prettier.
                                        After having configured stuff like that for more than a hundred times, I guess

                                        a precommit hook and a single script to run the code from root file.

                                        This post is the first one in what should be a series of articles about the
                                        topics I'm currently interested at. Lately I've been trying to improve my
                                        architecture design skills, so the topics I'm learning about are how to
                                        structure and manage state using Redux, how to model and formalize internal
                                        state in React components, and how to properly test all of the above. I think
                                        that these are some of the key issues which can make or break a project. So
                                        let's start with a messy one: how to deal with async actions in Redux.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Async actions are not really supported out of the box with redux. You either
                                        have to roll with your own solution, or use a
                                        library like <strong>redux-thunk</strong>. Thunks are a part of official
                                        documentation, so they are probably the most approachable solution. In my
                                        opinion, the first problem that thunks don't solve is the cancellation of async
                                        requests. I've found two alternatives that help with that: <strong>redux-saga</strong>
                                        and <strong>redux-observable</strong>. Both come with trade offs: sagas are
                                        based on generators which I personally don't prefer, and redux-observable uses
                                        RxJs operators, which take some bundle size tax.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Regardless of library used, there is some thinking involved in designing the
                                        redux
                                        modules based around async actions. <a href="https://medium.com/stashaway-engineering/react-redux-tips-better-way-to-handle-loading-flags-in-your-reducers-afda42a804c6">This</a>
                                        article shows a nice way to get rid of the involved boilerplate.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Update: </strong> it seems I was wrong when I said that cancellation
                                        can't be done with thunks.
                                        There is a way, and it involves using redux middleware. The article above made
                                        me think about that. Middleware is a great architectural option when you want
                                        to have control over all of the dispatched actions. I see a few situations when
                                        you'd like to have that control to cancel some requests: if a certain kind of
                                        request is still waiting for a response, but a new request of that kind is
                                        issued, we can cancel the existing one by just removing it from the list of
                                        pending requests. Browser will still execute the request, but no callback will
                                        be fired. Most importantly, no unexpected change in state will happen. The
                                        other situation that comes to mind is cancelling all requests when navigating.
                                        That is also simple: clear all the pending requests or provide a black list
                                        argument of request types to cancel.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Using statecharts: TODO add links to project and references (davidkpiano talk,
                                        xstate, reference website, my github project). Experience with statecharts so
                                        far:
                                        hiearchical approach allows for modular approach. Complex states can have child
                                        state which simplifies things, creates black boxes where you need them. Main
                                        concept to swallow to be able to use this effectively is that when a transition
                                        is made on a parent state, child states will be first to receive the
                                        transition. In case they can handle that kind of transition, they will do it.
                                        Instead, the transition will bubble up to the first parent which can do that
                                        transition. Kind of similar to JS prototype inheritance. Nice things which
                                        xstate provides: guards (conditional transitions), external state...

                                        Compared to reducers, state machines are pure functions which take the current
                                        state, and the wanted transition. New state is returned. That part is
                                        completely the same as with the reducers. But, state machines also define which
                                        transition is possible based on state and action, while in reducers you are
                                        much more free to do what you want. So state machines are more strict, which
                                        makes them tougher to develop and tougher to break unexpectedly.

                                        At first, it was so easy to edit this blog since it was just a static page with
                                        a few articles. Since I decided to write more posts, it became unwieldy. In the
                                        abundance of static site generators (<strong>SSG</strong>), I've picked <strong>Next.js</strong>.
                                        For
                                        me it seems to strike a good balance between simplicity and features. The
                                        situation I want to avoid is having to relearn how to use an SSG between two
                                        posts. So it's best to keep it simple. <a href="https://wookiehangover.com/writing/static-sites-with-next-js.html">This</a>
